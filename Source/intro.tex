\section*{Introduction}
\noindent This is a compendium of solutions of the Applied Differential Equations
qualifying exams dated from Spring 2007 to Spring 2015. This guide
contains solutions to 134 of the 137 questions asked in these 17 exams (the ones missing are Fall 2011 \#1, Spring 2011 \#2, and Fall 2009 \#3).
Sometimes the problem statements contain small errors so we have done our best to modify and solve the problem.
We have tried to be as complete as possible
so as to make the guide relatively self-contained. At the end we have also written up some useful
guides and tricks that we developed as we solved these problems. We hope the reader may find this compendium helpful
in studying. Originally it was planned on typing all the exams from Fall 1999 to Spring 2015, however partially
due to lack of time, we have only been able to type half of them, we have scanned our unedited solutions for Fall 1999--Fall 2006.\\

\noindent While doing the problems, we consulted the guides of
Alejandro Cantarero, Pascal Getreuer, Stuart Harrell, Jeffrey Hellrung, and Joseph Zipkin and so some of
our solutions may be similar to theirs. We also thank the Summer 2015 ADE study group (containing at various
times Yacoub Kureh, Alex Lin, Minh Pham, Michael Puthawala, and Stephanie Wang) for weekly problem discussion.
The phase portraits in this compendium were generated by a Mathematica program written by Yacoub Kureh.\\
